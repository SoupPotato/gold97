; Pokémon traded from RBY do not have held items, so GSC usually interprets the
; catch rate as an item. However, if the catch rate appears in this table, the
; item associated with the table entry is used instead.

TimeCapsule_CatchRateItems:
	db OLD_AMBER, GOLD_BERRY
	db APPLE, BERRY
	db SNAKESKIN, BERRY

	db ITEM_C3, BERRY
